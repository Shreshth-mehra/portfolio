                    <p>I am a 3rd year Mechanical engineering student at University of Waterloo. However, my learning extends beyond the class. If my hands could keep up with my mind, I would be building a new innovative project everyday.</p>
                    <p>As a sports enthusiast, I believe in the spirit of pushing my limits beyond perception. I completed the Ironman Triathlon (3.8km swim, 180km bike and 42.2km run) in 2019 at Mont Tremblant as the youngest competitor in the race. With only 8 months of training, the only goal was to see how far can I push my body and mind. </p>
                    <p>My love for nature drives me out of the house at every chance possible. I believe nature is embedded with creativity, beauty and intelligence, all you have to do is look. After all, some of the best creations in the world are inspired by observing the nature.</p>
